# JZ80
## Another Javascript Zilog Z80 CPU emulator
this project started with a simple thought in mind: user experience, the aim is just make your emulator (gb, msx, ZX spectrum, etc. ) as playable as possible, the cpu will run at maximum emulated speed (Z80 clock not emulated, just storing in a special register the clock variables). The emulator is still in early development and is not fully functional, it has a basic debug console based on foundation (!)
