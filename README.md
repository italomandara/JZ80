# JZ80
## Another Javascript Zilog Z80 CPU emulator
this project started with a simple thought in mind: user experience, the aim is just make your emulator (gb, msx, ZX spectrum, etc. ) as playable as possible, the syncronization will be based on 50/60 frames per second (but You can change that up to 1000 FPS or full speed  if you want), and the cpu will run at maximum emulated speed (Z80 clock not emulated, just storing in a special register the clock variables). The emulator is still in early development and is not fully functional, it has a basic debug console based on foundation (!)
