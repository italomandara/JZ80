# JZ80
## Another Javascript Zilog Z80 CPU emulator
this project started with a simple thought in mind: user experience, there will be no nanosecond precision cpu cycles, no emulation of every single part of the cpu nor state of the art coding style, just a core to get your emulator (gb, msx, ZX spectrum... ) as playable as possible, the syncronization will be based on 50/60 frames per second (but You can change that up to 1000 FPS if you want), and the cpu will run full speed (Z80 clock not emulated, just storing in a special register the timing variables). The emulator is still in early development and is not fully functional, it has a basic debug console based on foundation (!)
